# Personal Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts I have created for personal use. These scripts are designed to automate tasks, simplify workflows, or solve specific problems I encounter in my daily activities.

## Purpose
- The scripts here are primarily for my own convenience and may include tools for automation, file management, or other utilities.
- They are tailored to my specific needs but feel free to explore, adapt, or use them as inspiration for your own projects.

## Contents
- Bash scripts (`.sh`) with comments or a brief description of their functionality within the code. 

## Usage

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/chrisafk00/PersonalScripts.git

- Check individual script files for specific instructions or dependencies.

## Environment
